This code can be compiled by either importing the entire package into one of the IDE's or
by just importing the 4 java files in the src folder and running the Game.java file.

After running the Game.java, the user will be prompted to input the time limit and whether the player would like to go first.
Based upon the options entered, the game will be started with agent generating moves and player inputing the counter moves.
The program checks if the move entered by the player is valid. If not, the player is prompted to enter a valid move.
Finally, the one with all the four piece in a line wins!
